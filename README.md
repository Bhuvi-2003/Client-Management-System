# Client-Management-System
This Client Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline interactions between businesses and their clients. The system features two distinct user roles:

Admin Side: Admins can manage client information, track project progress, assign tasks, and monitor overall activity through a centralized dashboard.

Client Side: Clients can log in to view project updates, submit queries or feedback, and stay connected with the team in real time.

The platform ensures secure communication, organized project handling, and an efficient workflow for both parties.
